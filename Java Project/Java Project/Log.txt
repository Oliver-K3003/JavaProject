Austin --> I made the algorithm for finding what teacher is away and finding a replacement, this works but I need to add something where it checks for if the replacement is away too.
       --> I also made this log txt and the explaination file.

Kyle --> June 14: fixed the method that checks if a teacher can supervise or not.
     --> still need a way to account for the days. Example it needs to reset after a week and keep track if a teacher has 2 days in a row
